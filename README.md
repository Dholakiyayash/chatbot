# Chatbot Web App

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack chatbot web application that answers user queries and includes user authentication (sign up and login). The chatbot uses a locally hosted AI model (e.g., Llama 2 or Mistral) leveraging GPU acceleration for fast and efficient responses.

### Features
- Responsive web UI (React.js)
- Secure user authentication (sign up & login)
- Chat interface for user queries
- AI-powered answers using open-source models
- Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- Database for user and chat data (MongoDB)

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS or Material-UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **AI Model Server:** Python (Flask or FastAPI), Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Deployment:** Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku
